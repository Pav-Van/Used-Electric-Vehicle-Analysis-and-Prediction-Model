## Installation
 
The Anaconda distribution of Python is needed to run the code, as well as the squarify and lightgbm libraries. The notebook uses python 3.11.3. To download the cars.csv, Git LFS (Large File Storage) is needed.

## Project Motivation

In this jupyter notebook I was intrigued in using the Austin and Dallas Airbnb from Spring 2022 to gain insights on:

1. How do the prices for the Dallas airbnb's compare with the Austin airbnb's?

2. Does price correlate well with anything? Do the number of reviews correlate well with the availability? Are there any numerical columns that have a high correlation with other columns?

3. How well can we predict the price of an airbnb at the Dallas location?

## File Descriptions

All the code is contained in one jupyter notebook. The other files are .csv files containing the Airbnb data for each city.

## Results

The insights gained from the code can be found on this [post](https://medium.com/@Philip_Van/dallas-vs-austin-airbnbs-can-you-predict-the-prices-7c352a58d42)
